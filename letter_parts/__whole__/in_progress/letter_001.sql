VALUES ('whole', 'Trans Rights', 1, 'The environment facing transgender Americans right now is untenable. Across the country, states are putting forward and passing bills targeting trans folks'' access to healthcare, services, even bathrooms. On the one hand, "studies consistently show that access to gender-affirming care is associated with better mental health outcomes—and that lack of access to such care is associated with higher rates of suicidality, depression and self-harming behavior." (https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-the-science-on-gender-affirming-care-for-transgender-kids-really-shows/) On the other hand, legislatures in dozens of states have passed bills barring access to exactly that.\n\nIn some places, the assault on the rights of trans people has gotten so bad that organizations have issued travel advisories (https://eqfl.org/updated-travel-advisory-HRC). It is currently recommended that queer people—and especially transgender people—do not travel to Florida. The fact that a US state can be so human-rights hostile American citizens are advised against travelling there is appalling. And while Florida may be the champion of dangerous bigotry, plenty of other states are in close contention for first runner up. Without outspoken, proactive resistence by people like you, people who recognize the right of transgender people to live full and happy lives, people who recognize even the right of transgender people to live, the tide of hate will continue to sweep across the nation, drowning all those it washes over. Because the bigotry against queer people does not stand alone. The NAACP and LULAC have also issued travel advisories regarding Florida. The NAACP warns that "Florida has become hostile to Black Americans and in direct conflict with the democratic ideals that our union was founded upon." (https://naacp.org/articles/naacp-issues-travel-advisory-florida) Although the suffering of any group of people is sufficient to warrant fear and outrage, it is not only queer people who are put at risk by discriminatory legislation. States that successfully marginalize queer people will only be encouraged to assault the rights of people of color, immigrants, women, and anyone else who challenges the power of cisgender white men.\n\nAs your constituent, I urge you to speak up and speak loudly. Denounce the hate that is being perpetrated by legislators around the United States. Without resounding support and proactive protective legislation from legislators and executives who do not hold them in contempt, transgender and other queer people in this country will be left to stand alone against the bigotry. And they will stand, but they will do so at a disadvantage. People in this country who hate queer folks have no qualms about saying so loudly or about enshrining that hatred in the law. Those in positions of power who support the human rights of all Americans must be no less loud about it. Please, for my sake, and for the sake of all of your consituents, and for the sake of all people, be loud.');
