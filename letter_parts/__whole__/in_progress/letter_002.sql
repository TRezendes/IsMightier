'"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." Jefferson''s words, though simple, and possibly cribbed from other philosophers, are nevertheless elequent and moving. Of course, we know he didn''t mean it. Thomas Jefferson certainly did not believe that ALL men were created equal. At best, he meant "all men like me are created equal". White. Wealthy. And definitely  only MEN. Still, this nation is at its best when it tries to live up to the words as written, not the words as intended. It is no surprise, though, that you would side with a slave owner in interpreting this sentiment.
