As one of your constituents, I want to write and thank you for your support of the rights of transgender people. The lack of such support from so many at all levels of government is profoudnly disturbing, and I am happy to be represented by someone who believes that trans rights are human rights and that all people in this country, trans, cis, queer, straight, or have equal right to protection under the law. That said, mere support of trans rights is not enough. The Republican party is waging a war against trans folks, and they are not being met with nearly enough opposition.

Pennsylvania needs to become a haven for trans people. It is at least reassuring that on maps of the risks that trans people currently face in the United States (https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/first-period-anti-trans-legislative), Pennsylvania is marked as "Low Risk", but we should aim for better. "Low Risk" is good, but without legislative protections, that risk level could change with the next election, or the next one. We need to enshrine the rights of LGBTQIA+ people in law. Until legislation is passed that explicitly proihbits discrimination in education, employment, healthcare, housing, and public accomadation on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, LGBTQIA+ people in Pennsylvania will always live under threat of their lives and livelihoods being upended by bigots.

I thank you for your time and for your support. It is imperative for the safety and wellbeing of all Pennsylvanians and all Americans that you and your fellow legislators push to enact protections for trans and queer folks. Again, I am grateful for your support and for the the position you have taken thus far, but w ecan always do better, so I will always urge you to do more.
